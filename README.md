# Car Rear Camera with Hatch  

Illumination module with a camera hatch for Chevrolet Cruze, Lachetti, Aveo, Opel Astra, and many other GM cars.  

## 📌 About the Project  
One day, I was asked to design a rearview camera hatch for a Chevrolet. This hatch completely solves the problem of protecting the rear camera from rain and dirt.  

For the reference model, I used the factory-installed illumination module. The design ensures that, once all elements are installed, the module fits perfectly into the stock mount.  

## 🔧 Technical Details  
- **Servo control**: The code is simple and uses the **AlexGyver library** for smooth motor movement.  
- **Wiring:**  
  1. +12V activated with ignition  
  2. +12V activated in reverse drive mode  
  3. License plate light power  

- **Assembly:** Requires two **M2x10 screws** with M2 nuts and washers.  
- **Illumination:** Any LEDs can be used. I used **two 3.2V, 1A LEDs** with a **9-ohm resistor**.  
- **Camera:** AMiO HD-340 03536.
